# S - Single-Responsibility Principle

## Rule
- **Cohesion** - is the degree to which the various parts of a software component are related
    - **Higher Cohesion** - helps attain better adherence to the Single Responsibility Principle
- **Coupling** - Coupling is defined as the level of inter dependency between various software components
    - **Loose coupling** - helps attain better adherence to the Single Responsibility Principle
    - Note: Tight coupling is bad in software in general
